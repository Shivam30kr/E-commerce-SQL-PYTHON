Developed an E-commerce project utilizing Python and SQL to perform comprehensive data analysis and generate insights from sales data. 
The project involved creating and executing queries ranging from basic to advanced levels. Basic queries included listing unique customer cities, counting orders in 2017, 
and calculating total sales per category. Intermediate queries analyzed monthly order counts for 2018, average products per order by city, and revenue contributions by 
product category. Advanced queries calculated moving averages of order values, cumulative monthly sales, year-over-year growth rates, customer retention rates, and identified 
top-spending customers annually. This project provided in-depth insights to enhance business strategies and optimize sales performance.
